# The Ruins Mod - Fortress Ruins Fix for Alien drone Timer

Ever came across a Fortress Ruin with a energy crystal and thought it would be nice to get some energy from it? Ever happened to accidently shoot it while trying to clear the turrets that protect it?

If you answered yes you probably encountered the alien drones added by the Fortress Ruins that will protect the energy crystal. They're doing a fine job but unless you play with particular mods or don't actually care about the crystal you might end up in a situation where dozens of bots are protecting that crystal.

The default time to live for them is around 1 year. So you'd need to walk away from them for a whole year of real time to disappear. Which just seemed excessive for me and did tank my UPS. Hence I wrote this mod which adds a startup setting to reduce the time to live to a value of your choosing. By default it will be 3600 seconds (1 hour) which seemed like a good compromise between the bots being annoying and not just being a minor nuisance.
